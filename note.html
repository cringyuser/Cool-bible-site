        <h2>Chapter 1</h2>
        <div id ="note1" class="nota"><b>Note 1 =</b> וַיׇּהִי Qal form, preterite with consecutive/conversive wāw (w/c), 3rd person, masculine singular form the verb היה. “To be, come to pass”. The preterite + w/c (and suffixed conjugation + w/c) is the engine of Hebrew narrative. When it occurs at the beginning of a narrative, it performs the semantic role of alerting the reader that the story occurred at some point in the past. Subsequent occurrences in the story keep the action going. The wāw conjunction itself can be translated many ways, but as a wāw consecutive initiating a narrative, there are three or four main options. Older translation such as the King James Version renders it “And it came to pass”. More commonly it is rendered “now” (ESV, New Revised Standard Version), and some translations, recognizing its purely semantic function at the start of a narrative, omit it altogether.</div>
 	<div id ="note2"class="nota"><b>Note 2 =</b> דְּבַר־יְהֹוָ֔ה, noun masculine singular construct state (דבר word, thing, matter). דבר undergoes both tonic and pretonic reduction when in construct, i.e. the initial reduces to shewa and the second reduces to pataḥ; יְהֹוָ֔ה Proper Noun (theonym). The Tetragrammaton, or the covenant name YHWH, Yahweh, or LORD. How the divine revelation came to Jonah is not specified. Whether it was accompanied by a vision or an audition, or whether it was the voice in his soul that Jonah recognised as YHWH's command, the author does not say. If the text had historical intentions, we would wish to know how such a striking revelation could have come to Jonah, what the historical situation was, and what his own moral and prophetic preparation for this kind of a message consisted in. To try to account for it psychologically is however gratuitous, since the story is a poetic and not a historical account.</div>
	<div id ="note3"class="nota"><b>Note 3 =</b> יוֹנָ֥ה Proper Noun. There had been a prophet Jonah of Gath-Hepher in Zebulon, identified most probably with Meshed in Galilee, three miles north-east from Nazareth. He had predicted victory to King Jeroboam II in the ninth century B.C. according to 2 K. 14:25. Nothing else is known of him. Neither the Book of Kings nor the Chronicles tell anything else about him. It seems that his name attracted our author as especially appropriate for his purpose, for Jonah = Dove had become a symbolic name for Israel. Our author needed a representative name and "Jonah" suited his purpose.</div>
	<div id ="note4"class="nota"><b>Note 4 =</b> בֶן־אֲמִתַּ֖י “son of Amittai”. The two words are joined by the maqqef (-) which makes them effectively one, so that the unit functions appositionally. Apposition is the juxtaposition of one noun to the noun immediately preceding it. The second noun is essentially equivalent to the first, but provides further information about it. Amittai is etymologically linked to the word אמת, “truth”.</div>
	<div id ="note5"class="nota"><b>Note 5 =</b> ק֠וּם Qal form, imperative mood, masculine, singular. “To rise, stand”. The imperative is one of three volitional moods in Biblical Hebrew, the others being the jussive and the cohortative.The term volitional comes from the Latin volitio, and refers to a wish or desire on the part of the speaker for an action to happen. In introductory Hebrew it is usually taught as the mood of command, but it has many other nuances, including advice, invitation, permission, prayer, promise, request, warning, and concession. In this sentence it is the direct command use of the imperative: “rise!”. In most cases, the Qal imperative masculine singular is identical in form to the Qal infinitive construct form. This is the case with this Hollow verb (exceptions include original I-Wāw and III-Hē verbs) for which the passive participle has the same form. Hollow verbs have as their second radical either wāw or yôd, which is not retained in the suffixed verb or active participle. The wāw or yôd is preserved in the prefixed verb (except in the preterite w/c and jussive), cohortative, imperative (except for feminine plural), passive participle, and infinitive construct and absolute.</div>
	<div id ="note6"class="nota"><b>Note 6 =</b> נִֽינְוֵ֛ה Nineveh, or Nina and Ninud, was situated on the eastern bank of the Tigris opposite the modern Mosul, north of the greater Zab. It was a very ancient city founded most probably by the Babylonians. Sennacherib strongly fortified it and made it the capital of Assyria. But its time of splendour lasted only a century, for in 606 B.C. it was destroyed by the Medes. It was never rebuilt. The reason why he chose Nineveh as the place to which Jonah was to go, becomes clear as the story proceeds. Nineveh was the capital of the Assyrians, the bitterest enemies of Israel in pre-exilic times, and as such the best illustration for the author’s teaching. Even the cruel Assyrians were objects of YHWH's care. Even to them He gives an opportunity to repent, and thus to avert the punishment due to them.</div>
	<div id ="note7"class="nota"><b>Note 7 =</b> נה הָעִ֥יר הַגְּדוֹלָ֖ה “that great city”. Attributive use of the adjective. There are two points of grammatical interest. First, the article is used demonstratively (“that”), rather than as the ususal definitive function (“the”). The second is that the two words function as an epexegetical phrase that provides further information about Nineveh. Our narrator calls Nineveh that great city also in 3:3 and 4:11. It was important for his purpose to emphasise that it was such a great city, full of human beings, but it was not in existence in his day, for he speaks of it in 3:3 as a city of the past.</div>
	<div id ="note8"class="nota"><b>Note 8 =</b> רָֽעָתָ֖ם noun, feminine singular “evil, wickedness, misfortune, calamity, disaster” + pronominal suffix, 3rd person masculine plural. In what the wickedness consisted is not specified, but we know Assyria’s cruelties from her own inscriptions as well as from Na. 2:11, 2:12, 3:1, 3:19. YHWH is no longer a local or national deity, but the God of the whole earth, who punishes wickedness wherever. The emphasis on YHWH's sense of justice is necessary for the further development of the story.</div>
	<div id ="note9"class="nota"><b>Note 9 =</b> וַיָּ֚קָם Qal preterite, 3rd person masculine singular of the verb קום with consecutive/conversive wāw. Adversative use of the conjunction waw (“but”), because Jonah refused to obey the command. He did rise, but to flee from the presence of God and to escape from his duty.</div>
	<div id ="note10"class="nota"><b>Note 10 =</b> תַּרְשִׁ֔ישָׁה, proper noun, toponym. “Tarshish” + directive he, “to”. That he should at once have made up his mind to flee to Tarshish is unlikely. But when he arrived at Joppa and found the ship about to sail for Tarshish he quickly decided to take passage. The first mention of Tarshish in our text is therefore either due to prolepsis or, more likely, it is a later insertion. Tarshish is most probably to be identified with the Greek Tartessos in the SW. of Spain, near the mouth of the Guadalquivir River. It was most probably an ancient Semitic colony whose mineral trade with Tyre is mentioned in Ez. 27:12, It appears to have been the farthest point W. to which the Phoenician merchants went on their large, sea-going vessels, sometimes called Tarshish-ships, not because they all went to Tarshish, but because they belonged to the class that could make such extended tours. In going to Tarshish the author represents Jonah as going not only exactly in the opposite direction of Nineveh but also as trying to flee as far as possible away from YHWH's presence. Jonah was trying to flee from Palestine in order to escape a second command of YHWH. Just as a modern believer sometimes thinks of special places where God is more likely to reveal himself than at others, because he has experienced there communion with Him, so Jonah contrariwise in spite of his more advanced conception of God (cf. v. 9) thinks he can escape from the presence of God by fleeing as far as possible away from the place where the command of YHWH had reached him and where He would most likely, reveal Himself again to him. Even in still later days Palestine was regarded as the place of YHWH's special manifestation and presence, though the belief in His omnipresence had long been taught by prophets and psalmists.</div>
	<div id ="note11"class="nota"><b>Note 11 =</b> וַיֵּ֨רֶד Qal preterite with consecutive/conversive wāw, 3rd person masculine singular. “To go down, descend”. The double occurrence of וירד could be a subtle allusion to the increased distancing that Jonah creates between himself and YHWH. That there are five preterite w/c verbs imparts a sense of haste: Jonah made his decision to flee and acted on that decision with alacrity. It could also foreshadow Jonah’s submersion in chapter 2 (the verb also occurs in 2:6). Finally, note the irony (and even humour) that Jonah thinks that he can escape from God’s notice.</div>
	<div id ="note12"class="nota"><b>Note 12 =</b> יָפ֜וֹ Proper noun, toponym “Joppa”. The noun is an adverbial accusative of place (termination), so the translation should supply the preposition “to”. Yapho, the nearest seaport of Jerusalem, is the modern Jaffa, ar. Yafa. It has retained its location and name all through the centuries. In Egyptian inscriptions it is called Yepu, in the Amarna letters Yapu, in Assyrian inscriptions Yapu, Yappu.</div>
	<div id ="note13"class="nota"><b>Note 13 =</b> תַּרְשִׁ֔ישָׁה. The double occurrence of “to Tarshish” paired with “from YHWH” is significative, as it emphasizes his attempt to get as far as possible from the "awful" presence of YHWH. </div>
	<div id ="note14"class="nota"><b>Note 14 =</b> חִשְּׁבָ֖ה Piel, suffixed, 3rd person feminine singular, “to think, consider, devise”. As Tucker (2006: 19) notes, the language is figurative. Specifically, it is personification (i.e. the attribution of human attributes to non-human subjects), since inanimate objects do not think. The ship threatened to break in pieces, whether by the force of the waves or by being driven upon the reefs which make the Palestinian coast so dangerous, the author does not say. It is a vivid word he uses, for it represents the ship as an animate being, agitated, full of fear. </div>
	<div id ="note15"class="nota"><b>Note 15 =</b> אֱלֹהָיו֒ noun, masculine plural, “god, gods, God”) + 3rd person singular pronominal suffix. There are at least two possibilities by which to classify the plurality of the noun. One is the so-called plurality of majesty, i.e. “his God”, but would a Yahwistic writer conceive of the sailors’ deities honorifically? A second is simple plurality, i.e. “his gods”, reflecting the almost certain polytheism of the sailors. The second is contextually more fitting. They were no Hebrews, but probably Phoenicians, either natives or colonists; some may have been of other nationalities. They invoked the help of their various deities, each one crying to his own god, "ignorant of the truth, but not ignorant of the rule of providence" (Jerome). After the instinctive yielding to the impulse to pray they at once set to work to do all they could to save the ship.</div>
	<div id ="note16"class="nota"><b>Note 16 =</b> מֵֽעֲלֵיהֶ֑ם Preposition (spatial, “from”) + preposition (metaphorical/disadvantage, “against”) + pronominal suffix 3rd person singular. The two prepositions effectively produce a meaning which is not simply the sum of the two. Perhaps the sense is that the violence of the storm was such that it pitched one end of the ship over the other, with the vessels also tossed around. The idea then is that the ship was a danger to the mariners.  </div>
	<div id ="note17"class="nota"><b>Note 17 =</b> וְיוֹנָ֗ה The conjunction is clearly adversative: in contrast to the mayhem on deck, Jonah is fast asleep below. The revia is a strong disjunctive accent that evokes the idea of aposiopesis: the author is so astonished that he breaks off mid-sentence. Hence the translation could be “… but Jonah – he had gone down into the recesses of the ship!”</div>
	<div id ="note18"class="nota"><b>Note 18 =</b> הַסְּפִינָ֔ה article + noun feminine singular “vessel, ship”. The term is a hapax legomenon, or a word or form of a word that occurs only once in the Old Testament. The meaning of hapax legomena is sometimes obscure, so that it is often necessary to check the cognate languages. In this case, the Arabic safinat “ship” makes it reasonable to conclude for the same meaning here. </div>
	<div id ="note19"class="nota"><b>Note 19 =</b> מַה־לְּךָ֣ pronoun, interrogative (מַה) “what? How?” + preposition + pronominal suffix 2nd person masculine singular. The particle initiates an interrogative clause, which should be understood as a rhetorical question. The preposition is probably best classified as a dativus commodi, marking the pronominal suffix (ך) as the subject of this nominal clause. The noun clause מַה־לְּךָ֣ נִרְדָּ֑ם translates literally “What is it to you sleeping?” the participle with the interrogative being rare. The captain in going all over the ship came upon the sleeping Jonah in his corner on the lower deck. In his astonishment he shouts, what do you mean by sleeping! how can you sleep in such a storm! get up and pray to thy God! Astonishment is certainly in his tone, but whether also harshness and threat we cannot tell.</div>
	<div id ="note20"class="nota"><b>Note 20 =</b> אֱלֹהֶ֔יךָ noun masculine plural + pronominal suffix 2nd person masculine singular. It is tempting to translate it as “your god”, but the verse is before Jonah’s self-discourse as a monotheist (v.9). At this point for all the captain knows, Jonah is a polytheist as are he and his crew. He does not recognise him as a Hebrew nor does he mention the name of Jonah s God. Still less does he recognise him as a prophet whose prayer would be especially efficacious. He wants him to do something and not lie around and sleep. There is no hint that the captain thought that Jonah had intentionally refrained from praying and that he feared that Jonah s defiance of God was ominous. In such fearful danger everyone must do his share, no one must be idle. Since the sailors were doing all they could to save the ship, the only thing that Jonah could do was to pray. What a scene! The heathen sailor admonishes the Heb. prophet to pray! The narrator does not tell whether Jonah obeyed the command and we may therefore think that this was self-evident and for that reason omitted, or preferably that he simply rose and followed the captain to the upper deck. </div>
	<div id ="note21"class="nota"><b>Note 21 =</b> הָֽאֱלֹהִ֛ים Article + noun masculine plural. Regarding the definiteness of the noun, the article has several functions besides making definite the nominal to which it is attached. There are two possibilities here. The first is to denote a class of things, in this case deities i.e. “the gods”. Alternatively, the article can also have a demonstrative force, (i.e. “this”, “that”), i.e. “this god [i.e. Jonah’s]”. Again, because it seems more likely that the captain assumes that Jonah is a polytheist, the former is better suited to the context. On this interpretation the singular verb is what one usually finds with plural nouns of excellence/majesty. The other possibility would, however, follow the more usual Hebrew syntax, i.e. singular verb, singular subject.</div>
	<div id ="note22"class="nota"><b>Note 22 =</b> וְנַפִּ֣ילָה Conjunction + Hiphil cohortative, 1st person plural (נפל), “to fall upon; cast down, throw down”. The cohortative is the first-person volitional. Morphologically, it is often identical with the first-person prefixed (indicative) verb; but its distinctive feature is the â suffix, as it is here. It expresses resolve (“I will…”), request (either directly or as a wish), or exhortation (aka  the “hortatory” use, “Let us [cast lots]”. Here the cohortative is hortatory – one sailor imploring the others to act as resolved). The narrator uses here a device that is common all through antiquity, the casting of lots. Even the Urim and Tummim were sacred lots through which Yahweh announced His will. The decision of the lot was authoritative and final, because it was regarded as God s own decision. And they said one to another, come let us cast lots, that we may know for whose sake this disaster has come upon us. Evil is here physical evil, misfortune, disaster. The lots were either stones or other articles. When the lot fell upon Jonah there was no doubt in the minds of the men that he was the cause of the deity s anger, and they would, of course, not ask him after the decision to tell them for whose sake this disaster had come upon them. There is an exact parallel to this episode in the Buddhist story of Mittavindaka from Benares, who had gone to sea in disobedience to the command of his mother. The ship suddenly came to a stop on the sea and could not be made to proceed. The sailors cast lots in order to discover on whose account this calamity had happened. Three times the lot marked Mittavindaka as the guilty one. Whereupon the sailors set him adrift on a float with virtually the same words that the sailors use as they throw Jonah overboard, "many must not perish on account of this one."</div>
	<div id ="note23"class="nota"><b>Note 23 =</b> הַגִּֽידָה־נָּ֣א Hiphil imperative, masculine singular + paragogic he (נגד), “to declare, to tell” + particle of entreaty. One might be tempted to classify the imperative as direct command since the sailors are confronting Jonah; yet the presence of the particle of entreaty (נא) reduces the force to more of a request. The sailors confronted Jonah, albeit perhaps fearfully. </div>
	<div id ="note24"class="nota"><b>Note 24 =</b> וְאֵֽי־מִזֶּ֥ה עַ֖ם אָֽתָּה Conjunction + interrogative particle + pronoun, independent personal, 2nd masculine singular “you”. A final nominal sentence. The sailors pelt Jonah with a series of questions, the alacrity of which is augmented by their phrasing as nominal sentences. The effect is to heighten the intensity of the interrogation. </div>
	<div id ="note25"class="nota"><b>Note 25 =</b> עִבְרִ֣י noun gentilic, “Hebrew”. עִבְרִ֣י אָנֹ֑כִי constitutes a nominal sentence. Jonah’s answer to that series of question is brief and remarkable. He only replies to the question of his nationality, I am a Hebrew. This is the name which Israelites use with foreigners, Nationality and religion go together: And I worship Yahweh, the God of heaven who made the sea and the dry land. He does not insist on his special piety, but simply on his religious connection. He is a Yahweh worshipper. And quite in prophetic style he proceeds to describe Yahweh as the God of heaven. </div>
	<div id ="note26"class="nota"><b>Note 26 =</b> ְאֶת־יְהֹוָ֞ה This is the object, yet it occurs in the first position rather than in its normal syntactical position following the verb and subject. Such transposition is rhetorically significant, viz. the author wanted to emphasize that it is YHWH rather than some other deity whom Jonah serves and that YHWH is the creator of the cosmos.</div>
	<div id ="note27"class="nota"><b>Note 27 =</b> אֱלֹהֵ֚י הַשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ noun, masculine plural + article + noun masculine plural. The two words are in apposition to יְהֹוָ֞ה i.e. although one might dismiss them as superfluous, they provide further information about יְהֹוָ֞ה namely, that he is the deity of the heavens (הַשָּׁמַ֙יִם֙ being an objective genitive). Jonah’s choice of this apposition (or even epithet) is probably not accidental: he fears the god of the heavens, and the heavens are the source of the tempest that threatens the sailors. As the verse continues, Jonah will supply further important information about the nature of his god. Because the phrase “the god of the heavens” and the god “who made the sea and the dry land” is rather common parlance for most readers of the Bible, it is easy to lose the impact that this verse would have had on the sailors. Jonah tells them, effectively, that his god is more powerful than the forces arrayed against them at present, and many of those forces - principally the sea - were regarded as deities in much of the ancient Near East, e.g., the sea as Nun in Egypt, Tiamat in Mesopotamia, and Yam in Ugarit, or Ras Shamra. Small wonder, then, that the sailors respond as they do in v. 10. God of Heavem was a common title of Yahweh in postexilic times, as not only the documents in the book of Ezra but also the Jewish Aramaic papyri of Elephantine show. Yahweh s omnipotence and transcendence are expressed in this appellation. It is interesting to note that Jonah adds at once to this confession before the Phoenician sailors, some of whom worshipped as their chief god Baal Shamen=the Lord of heaven, that Yahweh had made the sea and the dry land. By proclaiming himself a servant of Yahweh, the God of heaven, who had made and who controlled the sea and the dry land, he made clear that Yahweh had sent this storm upon the sea. And since the lot had pointed him out as the culprit, that Yahweh was pursuing him. The narrator does not represent Jonah as becoming conscious of the incongruity of his flight and of his belief, though Jonah realises that he cannot escape Yahweh anywhere on land or sea.</div>
	<div id ="note28"class="nota"><b>Note 28 =</b> כִּי־יָֽדְע֣וּ הָֽאֲנָשִׁ֗ים כִּֽי־מִלִּפְנֵ֚י יְהֹוָה֙ ה֣וּא בֹרֵ֔חַ This is a (subordinate) causal clause that explains the sailors’ question.  Jonah s confession produced great fear among the sailors. They did not know the reason of his flight, for he had not said anything about it to them. They thought him a criminal, perhaps a murderer fleeing from justice, whom the angry god (who was in control of the sea as well as of the dry land) was pursuing in the storm on the sea. And full of horror they exclaimed, What hast thou done! They do not ask for information about the nature of his crime but are horrified at his bold attempt to flee from the Almighty God. The author of the alteration in v.9 added in v. 10, as an explanation of the exclamation of the sailors, for the men knew that he was fleeing from the presence of Yahweh. And a reader of the altered text of v. 9, wondering how the sailors could know why he had fled, and interpreting their knowledge in line with vv. 1-3, wrote in the margin, for he had told them. This was introduced into the text later on. But its secondariness is apparent from the awkward construction in which the two causal sentences follow each other without connection. </div>
	<div id ="note29"class="nota"><b>Note 29 =</b> וַֽהֲטִילֻ֣נִי Conjunction + Hiphil imperative masculine plural (טול) + pronominal suffix, 1st person singular. The question from the previous verse means that this imperative is counsel or advice rather than a direct command. Jonah tells them to throw him overboard, for I realise, he says, that it is for my sake that this great tempest is upon you. He had not gained this knowledge by the decision of the lot, but by the voice of his conscience. And he knew that the storm would be calmed by his sacrifice, for then the reason for the storm would be removed. It was an ancient sailor s custom to quiet the stormy sea by turning the guilty person adrift or throwing him overboard when it had become evident that the god of the sea demanded it, like in the story of Mittavindaka given above.</div>
	<div id ="note30"class="nota"><b>Note 30 =</b> וַיַּחְתְּר֣וּ Qal preterite with consecutive/conversive wāw 3rd person masculine plural “to dig, to row”. The conjunction could be rendered simple sequence (“and”). Since, however, the sailors do not follow Jonah’s advice, it seems contextually better to classify it as adversative. The sailors hesitated to follow Jonah s advice. They were in doubt whether Yahweh would be pleased with it. They did not know what Jonah had done and could not be sure that all that Yahweh wanted might not simply be his return to the land. So, they tried their utmost to reach the shore. The narrator had said nothing of any previous attempt on their part to reach the shore and this is quite in line with what we know about the custom of sailors during storms along the Palestinian coast. Usually, they prefer to seek the open sea rather than risk being wrecked upon the reefs of the dangerous coastline. Although they are Gentiles, the sailors, having ascertained that Jonah was responsible for the storm, and having been told by Jonah how to remedy the situation, nevertheless attempt a course that is counter to his counsel and, unbeknownst to them, to the divine will. Presumably this is because they had high regard for human life – even if it was someone from another race/country whose negligence had placed them in harm’s way, and lost them their livelihood. Contrast this benevolence with Jonah’s disregard for Gentiles in the reproach by YHWH in 4:11.</div>
	<div id ="note31"class="nota"><b>Note 31 =</b> אָֽנָּ֚ה Particle of interjection “ah, now!”. The particle introduces the first of two desiderative clauses, i.e. clauses expressing a desire or a wish. Tucker (2006: 42) observes that the particle often begins laments. Followed by ֹֽאבְדָ֗ה  אַל־נָ֣א - more specifically, it is a cohortative of injunction: the speakers are expressing an immediate wish, or in this context, a prayer. The abundance of the particles of entreaty, volitional verbs, etc. make for a highly emotive verse.</div>
	<div id ="note32"class="nota"><b>Note 32 =</b> דָּ֣ם noun masculine singular, “blood”. A figure of speech, specifically a metonymy of the contained or adjunct, i.e. not simply the Jonah’s blood, but all of Jonah. In the Old Testament, blood was reckoned as the actual life force of a person.</div>
	<div id ="note33"class="nota"><b>Note 33 =</b> וַיִּזְבְּחוּ־זֶ֙בַח֙ לַֽיהֹוָ֔ה וַיִּדְּר֖וּ נְדָרִֽים This verse has three pairs of verbs and nouns from the same root. This is not because of a lack of vocabulary in Biblical Hebrew; rather, such pairings are alliterative (the repetition of similar sounds), perhaps reflecting an oral origin of the story in which assonance (repetition of similar vowel sounds) and consonance (repetition of similar consonant sounds) were mnemonic aids for the teller and audience. The sailors, profoundly impressed by the sudden calm and overawed by this manifestation of Yahweh’s power, feared Yahweh with a greatfear. At once they offered sacrifices and vowed to pay their homage to Him after reaching their destination. What they vowed the narrator does not say. He did not feel the difficulty of the older exegetes whence the sailors took the sacrificial animals. He does not say that they were converted and became henceforth true Yahweh-worshippers, but rather describes a scene which harmonises with ancient religion and its recognition of the existence of many gods.</div>

        <h2>Chapter 2</h2>
	<div id ="note34" class="nota"><b>Note 34 =</b> וַיְמַ֚ן Piel form, preterite, with consecutive/conversive wāw, 3rd preson singular of the verb מנה “to send, appoint, ordain”. The final he of III-He verbs routinely apocopates (drops) when inflected. The verb מנה also occurs in 4:6, 4:7 and 4:8 where YHWH “appoints” a plant, worm and scorching wind, respectively. The four-fold use of the same verb, with YHWH as its subject, is an example of how the writer uses repetition, in this case to underline the sovereignty of God over nature in general and sea and earth creatures in particular.</div>
	<div id ="note35" class="nota"><b>Note 35 =</b> דָּ֣ג noun masculine singular “fish”. The Heb. speaks simply of a great fish, not of a whale. Commentators have thought of a large shark (squalus carcharias), Quandt and more recently P. Haupt of a cachalot or sperm-whale. But the author did not specify the kind of fish; whether he was not interested in this or did not know enough about it, we cannot tell. He had probably heard stories of huge sea-monsters which had swallowed men whole and alive. The fish has no other purpose in the story than to swallow Jonah and thus to save him from drowning and eventually to bring him back to the shore. Haupt believes that it was brought into the story "in order to transport the disobedient prophet as speedily as possible from Joppa, the seaport of Jerusalem, to Alexandretta, the terminus of the shortest route from the Mediterranean to Nineveh." But our author does not say where Jonah was ejected.</div>
	<div id ="note36" class="nota"><b>Note 36 =</b> וַיִּתְפַּלֵּ֣ל The psalm which is reported as Jonah’s prayer was interpolated later. Originally, the author simply meant prayer for deliverance, the words of which are not given, and he didn’t refer to this psalm, which was added later. V. 2 speaks of a prayer which was prayed in the stomach of the fish, not after the deliverance from the fish, while the psalm is not a prayer for deliverance but a thanksgiving after deliverance. V. 2 is sometimes regarded as the introductory part of the interpolation. The psalm is composed of pentameters, so-called kinah-lines. Usually, two together are regarded as forming strophes of four half-lines each. The only exception to this is v. 9 where we have a single kinah. Reuss and Marti think that the other line has been accidentally omitted. </div>
	<div id ="note37" class="nota"><b>Note 37 =</b> קָ֠רָא֠תִי  This verse marks the beginning of Jonah’s lament, which is composed in verse (poetry). As such it is abundant in the poetics (features) of that medium, and attending to them brings a greater awareness of the poem’s meaning and rhetorical force. Rhetoric is at work in the verse as well. In line A Jonah addresses YHWH in third person, but in B2 he shifts to second person. The change has the effect of heightening the sense of spiritual intimacy or proximity between YHWH and Jonah. Parallelism, a type of repetition, is another feature of Hebrew poetry, and is found in virtually every verse of poetry in the Old Testament. There are many types, but all work from correspondence between the “parallel members” of a verse. The line (aka stich, colon, verse) is divided into two hemistichs. The end of the first is almost invariably marked by the ‘atnāḥ accent. Hence in the translation, there are two cola (A, B), both of which have two hemistichs (A1, A2; B1, B2). This verse is an example of internal  “formal” or “synthetic” parallelism: no correspondence of terms occurs between the hemistichs of either clon. Instead, the second hemistich completes the thought of the first. That is, A2 completes the idea of A1, and B2 completes the idea of B1. This verse also has external incomplete parallelism between the cola. That is, some of the members of colon A correspond with some of the members of colon B. </div>
	<div id ="note38" class="nota"><b>Note 38 =</b> שְׁא֛וֹל In the Hebrew Bible, "Sheol" (שְׁאוֹל) refers to the abode of the dead, often translated as "hell" or "the underworld". Within the Hebrew Bible, there are few—often brief and nondescript—mentions of Sheol, seemingly describing it as a place where both the righteous and the unrighteous dead go, regardless of their moral choices in life. The general characteristics of an afterlife such as Sheol were not unique to the ancient Israelites; the Babylonians had a similar underworld called Aralu, and the Greeks had one known as Hades. As such, it is assumed that the early Israelites believed that the grave of family, or tribe, all united into one, collectively unified "grave", and that this is what the Biblical Hebrew term Sheol refers to: the common grave of humans.</div>
	<div id ="note39" class="nota"><b>Note 39 =</b> וַתַּשְׁלִיכֵ֚נִי As with v. 3, this verse has two cola. Colon A, however, is comprised of tristichs, while colon B has hemistichs. The first two tristichs of A show the pattern of terrace parallelism, which Watson describes as “a form of repetition where the last part of a line is repeated as the beginning of the next line”. It should not be confused with staircase parallelism, “a form of couplet (or tricolon) which proceeds in steps”. </div>
	<div id ="note40" class="nota"><b>Note 40 =</b> וַֽאֲנִ֣י Conjunction (inferential “so”) + pronoun, independent personal 1st person singular. Since the following verb (אָמַ֔רְתִּי) also supplies the subject “I”, the pronoun appears superfluous. IN these, circumstances, however, the pronoun is emphatic – the Hebraic way of writing in italics.</div>
	<div id ="note41" class="nota"><b>Note 41 =</b> נִגְרַ֖שְׁתִּי מִנֶּ֣גֶד עֵינֶ֑יךָ According to the old idea YHWH had nothing to do with the nether world. He was a God of the living and not of the dead. This conception persisted even after others had been introduced. The inserter of the psalm may well have seen here a point of connection with Chapter I v.3 There Jonah fled away from the prese Since God does not have physical eyes, this is a figure of speech, specifically, an anthropomorphism. Since of Yahweh, here he realises that he has been banished from Him, out of His sight.  This verse consists of bicola, the hemistichs in both of which feature internal formal parallelism. Moreover, the adversative אַךְ that begins B1 and the contrasting ideas between A and B make the two cola an example of external antithetic parallelism: even though Jonah has been expelled from the presence of YHWH (A), the prophet will nevertheless seek him (B).</div>
	<div id ="note42" class="nota"><b>Note 42 =</b> הֵיכַ֖ל קָדְשֶֽׁךָ “the holy temple” To the Hebrew the temple at Jerusalem was the seat where Yahweh dwelt. Surprising as the reference to it here may seem to us who would have thought rather of the light of heaven in such a connection and therefore of the heavenly temple in which Yahweh dwelt, to the devout Jew this was natural. For he thought of Yahweh as living among His people, toward the temple he looked when he prayed and into the temple the prayer would come to Yahweh who heard it. The psalmist feels that this will henceforth be impossible for him, for he is doomed to death.</div>
	<div id ="note43" class="nota"><b>Note 43 =</b> אֲפָפ֚וּנִי Qal suffixed 3rd person  “to surround” + pronominal suffix 1st person singular. When pronominal suffixes are added to verbs, internal vowel changes result. The Hebew idiom, “the waters closed in upon me”, means either until I could not breathe, to suffocation, or unto (my) life. </div>
	<div id ="note44" class="nota"><b>Note 44 =</b> הָרִים֙ He had sunk deep down to the ends or roots of the mountains, down to the foundations of the earth; in Ecclus. 16:29 both the roots of the mountains and the foundations of the earth are mentioned together. The Hebrews believed that the earth was founded upon the subterranean ocean (Ps. 242) and that the ends of the mountains, the pillars of the earth, went deep down to its foundations.</div>
	<div id ="note45" class="nota"><b>Note 45 =</b> בְּרִחֶ֥יהָ. Article + noun masculine plural “bar” + pronominal suffix, 3rd person singular. The term is usually used in association with doors and fates or prisons. Here the term is a hypocatastasis for some sort of geological barriers at the sea floor (perhaps mountains or canyon walls) that constrained Jonah. The singer had sunk down lower and lower and had arrived at the gates of the land whose gate-bars are eternal bolts, which are never opened again after the wanderer has once been admitted. It is the gate of the land of the dead through which the dead soul enters: Sheol, which lay, as the ancient Hebrews believed, below the subterranean ocean. Here the drowning man had arrived at the gates of death, when Yahweh suddenly saved him. The Babylonian ideas of the nether world were so similar that it is possible to fill out the fragmentary notices of the OT. by Babylonian parallels.</div>
	<div id ="note46" class="nota"><b>Note 46 =</b> וַֽאֲנִ֗י Adversative conjunction. In contrast to these idolaters our singer to whom Yahweh is his Love or Refuge declares fervently that he will cling to Yahweh. With loud songs of thanksgiving will he sacrifice to Him. He means evidently material sacrifices (cf. Heb. word slaughter = sacrifice) , for he mentions also his willingness to pay the vows which he had made in the hour of his desperate need and which, according to ancient belief, were efficacious in eliciting God s aid. There were many different kind of vows, vows of a material and of a spiritual nature. Which were prominent in this psalmist s case we do not know. One might ask whether the inserter of the psalm interpreted this as referring to a vow of strict and unqualified obedience which Jonah made in the fish. But we cannot tell, since he says nothing about it. </div>

        <h2>Chapter 3</h2>
	<div id ="note47" class="nota"><b>Note 47 =</b>  שֵׁנִ֥ית Adjective (ordinal) feminine singular. There is no reproach of the prophet s former dis obedience but simply the quiet reiteration of the command which brings out most beautifully Yahweh’s gracious kindness.</div>
	<div id ="note48" class="nota"><b>Note 48 =</b> ק֛וּם These words are repeated verbatim from 1:2. Repetition is an important part of narrative. The reiteration of this command from 1:2 is akin to a re-commissioning of Jonah to preach to Nineveh. The author says nothing about Jonah s thoughts and feelings with which he set out to do his duty. And we need not speculate on them either. He knew that the duty could not be evaded.</div>
	<div id ="note49" class="nota"><b>Note 49 =</b>  עִיר־גְּדוֹלָה֙ לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים Three grammatical matters are essential to keep in mind in order to translate this phrase: (1) The first is the superlative degree regarding לֵֽאלֹהִ֔ים distinguishes between the comparative and the absolute superlative. The latter, which is the case here, is used when “some person or thing is judged to excel in some quality, state, or condition”. On this basis the noun is translated as “exceedingly” and rendered as an attributive adjective, modifying עִיר and with גְּדוֹלָה֙ it forms a chain of attributive adjectives. (2) The second matter is the use of the lāmed preposition prefixed to אלֹהִ֔ים. It is one of the miscellaneous uses of the preposition, here to avoid having a construct relationship of three or more nouns. As such the preposition is more of a semantic marker and is not translated. (3) The third aspect is the multiple-word construct. In such cases the translation follows the word order of the phrase, here, literally “a city of great of exceeding” or, more smoothly “an exceedingly great city”. There are at least two other plausible translations for this phrase: “a great city to the gods” and “a great city belonging to God”.</div>
	<div id ="note50" class="nota"><b>Note 50 =</b> שְׁלֹ֥שֶׁת cardinal adjective masculine singular “three”. At first it seems as if the circumference of the city were meant, so that it would take three days to travel around it. This would agree with the statement of Diodorus (2:3) based on Ktesias that Nineveh s circumference was 480 stadia, which would be equivalent to a three days journey, for Herodotus (5:53) estimates 150 stadia for a day s march and the present-day estimate of about 20 to 25 miles for it agrees with this. But that our author meant the diameter of the city is clear from v.4 which implies that one day s march was only the beginning of Jonah’s journey. Such exaggerations are characteristic of stories like this.</div>
	<div id ="note51" class="nota"><b>Note 51 =</b>  אַרְבָּעִ֣ים “forty”. The original reading was “three days”, as the story moves rapidly and three days are much more in accord with it. After Jonah had traversed the city from west to east he could expect the judgment. So he sat down and waited, but not forty days.</div>
	<div id ="note52" class="nota"><b>Note 52 =</b> צוֹם֙ unexpectedly, the people of Niniveh believed Jonah’s message and all repented immediately, proclaimed a fast and clothed themselves in sackcloth, all of them without exception, earnestly hoping that God would see their self-abasement and penitence, take pity on them, pardon their sins and avert the disaster. Fasting and putting on of sackcloth are the outward signs of the sincere and whole-hearted penitence of the Ninevites.</div>
	<div id ="note53" class="nota"><b>Note 53 =</b> מֶ֣לֶךְ The author gives no name, he calls him simply the King of Nineveh, as is customary in such stories, for it adds nothing to the tale. The king also believes at once, stands from the throne, puts of his mantel and covers himself with sackcloth and ashes as a sign of humiliation and grief.</div>
	<div id ="note54" class="nota"><b>Note 54 =</b> הָֽאָדָ֨ם וְהַבְּהֵמָ֜ה The decree commands that everybody in Nineveh, including the domestic animals, shall observe a strict fast, put on sackcloth, earnestly pray to God with all might and abandon his sins. The edict impresses some commentators as somewhat humorous. Even if he were humorous in other places, here he would defeat his own end by a humorous touch. The humour is due to a copyist’s mistake. The domestic animals are to join in the general abasement and so are to be deprived of food and drink. Though the parallel in Judith 410 shows that the custom which Herodotus (9:24) reports of the Persians when the animals participated in the ceremonies of mourning for Masistius, was also Jewish, it is apparent that a copyist repeated somewhat carelessly and animals from v. 7 after men in v. 8, so that the text now says that the animals were not only to be clothed in sackcloth but should also cry to YHWH and repent of their evil ways. This was evidently not intended by the original author. The outward signs of penitence are to be matched by true repentance and reformation.</div>

        <h2>Chapter 4</h2>
	<div id ="note55" class="nota"><b>Note 55 =</b> וַיֵּ֥רַע Qal preterite with consecutive/conversive wāw, 3rd person, masculine singular (רעע) “to be bad, not fit for use, evil, displeasing”. The verse is somewhat unusual in that the syntax is not the standard verb + subject + object, nor is there a discrete subject; it is the somewhat vague “it” that the verb’s third person number supplies. This is a case of an impersonal construction where the verb has “no topic in view other that the condition or action expressed by the predicate”. There are several types of impersonal, this one being an “emotional”, which “represents the emotion as coming from outside”. Jonah recognises that Yahweh has forgiven Nineveh and that He will not destroy it. He needed no special divine revelation for this, for it was in accord with Yahweh s character and prophetic doctrine. Nor did he need to wait till the time of grace was over to know Yahweh s change of attitude. He knew it as soon as he saw the repentance of the people. But instead of rejoicing over YHWH’s kindness, he was displeased exceedingly and very angry.</div>
	<div id ="note56" class="nota"><b>Note 56 =</b> יָדַ֗עְתִּי That was exactly what he had feared when he was still at home. It was for this reason, he tells Yahweh, in an indignant prayer, that he had fled when the divine command came to him the first time. He knew Yahweh s wonderful grace, His patience and readiness to relent, too well, not to foresee that He would forgive the Ninevites if they repented. And he had no desire to be the messenger who was to warn them of the doom to come and thus be the means of saving them. He hoped and wished that Nineveh go down to its doom unwarned. His remonstrance is put by the author in the form of a prayer in order to mitigate its bitterness. He knew that in uttering the prediction he was warning the Ninevites, and he says himself that he knew it would not be fulfilled, if they repented. </div>
	<div id ="note57" class="nota"><b>Note 57 =</b> הַֽהֵיטֵ֖ב חָ֥רָה לָֽךְ YHWH is dealing gently with Jonah, He is in no haste to insist on swift repentance, but wants to develop in Jonah the thought of the impropriety of his anger. Strangely enough no answer to Yahweh s question is recorded. If it has not been omitted accidentally, we must understand that Jonah did not answer. According to Budde, this is because this verse is not original here.</div>
	<div id ="note58" class="nota"><b>Note 58 =</b> אֲשֶׁ֣ר יִרְאֶ֔ה Jonah had gone all through the city, he had finished his commission, he knows its result and now he sits down to rest in his dejected mood. An ancient reader wondered why he should stay there, and so put in the explanatory statement until he might see what would happen to the city. But Jonah knew this already, and the author of the story could hardly put this in, for he gives no hint that Jonah had any hope whatever that Yahweh would destroy the city after all, and thus there would be no reason for him to make such a statement. </div>
	<div id ="note59" class="nota"><b>Note 59 =</b> סֻכָּ֗ה  We saw in connection with 3:4 that the original text read, in yet three days Nineveh will be destroyed! The three days had been changed to forty. The glossator read forty in his text and he concluded that if Jonah had to stay so long he would need a hut as a protection from the hot sun. So he inserted, and he made himself a hut and set down under it in the shade. This was a natural re flection and yet unwittingly he spoiled by it the point of the following, for if Jonah could sit in the shade of the hut, the shade of the plant was not so necessary as v. 8 assumes. According to v. 8 Jo nah had no other shelter from the rays of the sun than the plant. This difficulty cannot be evaded by pointing to the refreshing shade of the green leaves of the tree and to the unsatisfactory shelter of the hut. If the true character of v. 5b as an explanatory gloss is recognised, the difficulties connected with this verse disappear. According to the original story Jonah needed neither to wait until he would see what would happen to the city, for he knew it already, nor to make a hut, for the time allowed was not long enough.</div>
	<div id ="note60" class="nota"><b>Note 60 =</b>  קִֽיקָי֞וֹן The plant, called in Hebrew kikayon, was most probably the ricinus or castor-oil tree (AVm. palm-christ, RVm. Palma Christi) which has large leaves supplying welcome shade, and whose growth is rapid. Of course, its growth is here miraculously accelerated, for it springs up and grows during a single night.</div>
	<div id ="note61" class="nota"><b>Note 61 =</b> ר֚וּחַ the much-dreaded sirocco with its oppressive and exhausting heat and dust. The east wind is introduced not for the purpose of drying up the plant (Bu.), or of tearing down the hut (Wkl.), but of intensifying the physical and mental distress of the prophet. It aggravates the discomfort of a hot summer-day manifold as everyone who has experienced it can testify. And so it did with Jonah.</div>
	<div id ="note62" class="nota"><b>Note 62 =</b> חַ֙סְתָּ֙ Qal suffixed 2nd masculine singular (חוס) “to pity, look on with compassion”.	YYHWH compares Jonah s attitude toward the ricinus with His own attitude toward Nineveh. Thou wast full of pity on account of the ricinus because it perished so soon. And yet it was only a wild plant, it did not belong to thee. Thou couldst not possibly have for it the interest and the attachment of one who had planted and tended it, for thou hadst done nothing at all for it. Besides, it was but ephemeral, it grew up in a night and perished in a night (Heb. son of a night), it was therefore not of much value nor could thy attachment to it be so very deep because it lived such a short time. And yet thou didst pity it when it died.</div>
	<div id ="note63" class="nota"><b>Note 63 =</b> וַֽאֲנִי֙ All this is implied in the contrast to v.10. He implies that Nineveh is of far more importance and value than a wild ephemeral plant ! Yahweh had laboured for it, for He, the only God, was the creator of all the inhabitants as well as of the animals, and He had made the city grow to such wonderful greatness.</div>
